SVG Logo Maker

## Description

For this homework challenge, we were to create an svg logo generator through node using objecct oriented programming. This challenge requires installing node, jest, and inquirer beforehand. Then I wrote the code in JavaScript that will create the color and shapes when "node index.js" is entered in the terminal. There will be a prompt of questions where user input is required then it will generate the svg logo. See video link below at the end for walkthrough example.

## Installation

To install, copy the repository link and clone this repository into your computer

## Usage

After cloning the repository and installing the required programs, open your terminal. Enter node index.js once you are in the correct folder for the svg logo generator. Then there will be a prompt of questions, once correctly answered, it should read "Generated logo.svg". 

This SVG logo generator can be used for different projects such as branding, graphic design, hobby/DIY projects, and etc.
